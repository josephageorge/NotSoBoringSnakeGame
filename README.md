# NotSoBoringSnakeGame
Made a snake game where the apple has more life than expected...very 2000s. 

- Worked in Pygame, first time ever. Main issues were with fixing the range of the apple and how fast it was moving. Still working on how to get rid of buggy overlaps when the snake should be receiving a point but is just overlapping with the snake. It likely has to do with the size of the apple but I want to see if I can preserve the integrity of the game.
- Also want to add power-ups where there are two apples, or the apple is still.
- Final level of this would be to make a boss round where the apple chases the snake, but need to research A* and how to implement it cleanly.
